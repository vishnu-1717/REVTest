Q&A

Questions We Asked

What is the biggest reason you want to gain control of your finances right now?

Financial freedom and ability to retire early. They want to build wealth and have more freedom in their lives.

What does financial freedom mean to you?

Being able to retire early, not work a conventional 9-5 job, have freedom to live wherever they want, travel whenever they want, and visit family on their own schedule.

How much do you think you've lost in the last three years from option trading?

Jon lost about $26,000 in one year from options trading.

Was there a specific turning point that made you want to make changes?

A significant increase in property taxes (mortgage payment went up $1,200/month) made them realize they need to manage their money better.

What do you feel is missing in your approach right now that's holding you back from saving more and investing more?

Lack of discipline and control in their budget. They often overspend on social events and dining out, sometimes dipping into savings.

Have you thought of what you'll need to be in a position of financial freedom or retirement?

They estimate needing $3-4 million, with monthly expenses in retirement of about $10,000.

Questions They Asked

How long do we have access to the incentive payments?

The incentive-based pricing is only available during the call.

Is there a minimum amount of money we have to invest to be a member of the program?

No, there's no minimum investment required beyond the program fee.

What does the 1-1.5 hours per week entail?

Learning the ins and outs of budgeting, investing, taxes, and real estate through videos and assignments. By the end, they'll have an automated system personalized for their financial goals.

Have you been through the academy yourself?

Chris (the sales rep) completed the program 14 months ago and has been working with BudgetDog for a year. He shared his positive experience and results.

Steven and Lauren are currently bringing in around $8,300 per month after taxes, with $85,400 in savings.

CURRENT

Lots on credit cards (0%)

10k more in cash than total CC debt —> 56k
43 on 0%,
13k on regular cards
60k in cash

9k + 4500
13500 after tax total.
(Hopefully more)

5300 in rent / living
3k in nannies 
1000 Ubers, 
1000 for food
2000 for RE

500 net per month.

Business is good, personal isn’t great. Not a financial advisor, but a coach.

Help find missing subscriptoins
What are you spending your money on, 
Pay yourself first, Change how your. Mortgage is structured.

Only working with 1k a month (that's her take home from her checks), and she also uses that to contribute to her retirement accounts. So whatever she has after, is what she can use

Has a husband, but he's not on board with it.  But she is the decision maker.  He doesn't believe in investing for retirement, and has 100k cash laying around.  He's a ""dig a hole in the ground, and bury it there"" kind of guy

Other Notes
He's been using excel and AI to help come up with a budget, but he's not able to get a grasp on whats going on.  He really wants to automate everything so he doesn't have to think about it, but he was really nervous when I mentioned we use AI to automate his accounts.

The 6k took him by surprise, and needs to consult with his wife.  I emphasized the investment goes towards securing his families financial future, and just by the budgeting, our clients average 24k in savings in the first year, so that 6k is offset by that.

He made it seem like he didn't know there was an academy and said he clicked on the ad that was offering a free course, and something about 3 of our clients.

He looked for guidance and support specifically on the type of investments he was doing, he was already investing but just didn't know if what he's doing is the right thing.

He was bleeding money on the budgeting side as well and that cost him a car over the last 2 years which he's been saving for since January.

  - Vejohn clarified these calls are for 1-on-1 mentorship signups, not advice-giving
  - 45-minute call length surprised Kylie, indicating lack of proper briefing
  - Vejohn unable to provide the type of information Kylie sought

Technical Issues

  - Kylie's camera non-functional during call
  - Vejohn turned off his camera to avoid ""staring at himself""

Next Steps

Koey was getting uncomfortable, but I kept my ground and kept digging, till he finally admitted he needs the help, and became more conversational.

Never had role models for managing money.

Struggled with lack of discipline + clarity around budgeting.

Caring for MIL adds complexity:

Shared expenses unclear (groceries, trips, etc).

Often “throw money at stress.”

Immediate needs (car breakdown, renovations, caregiving) consumed savings → no margin for investing.

12k net income
40k credit card debt, cards almost maxed out.  
roughly 9k expenses minus credit cards, 
2k goes to credit cards
Leaves 1k left over, and that goes fast to gas and groceries, then spends rest on credit cards.

Problem:
Has tried budgeting on her own for three years
Before husband became disabled, she paid off debt, but would go back into it
Now since one income home, the debt has gotten out of hand
Every effort of budgeting and paying off didn't work

Was very closed off at the beginning, and asked why so many questions
She didn't understand my question of ""what have you tried, or what have you done to try and pay off the cards"".  She literally said, ""I don't know what that means""
Kept digging on what was happening, then she finally said, she was raised to not talk about finances, cause it shows a sign of weakness.  Only talk about it, if you're doing well.
Dug into that, to where she said she needs to change, and being on the call was the first step to talk to someone

Fear objection at end
During Tie down, I brought it up after she said, ""theoretically it could help"", asked what that meant
Brought her back in by asking and pointing out that it comes from her old habit of thinking.  then asked how that has served her, and she realized she was falling back into old habits.
Got her to say that she is committed to changing and taking the next step

She was taken back by the 6k investment
Objection handled by analogies and reframes, but she didn't understand and couldn't process any of it... 
She finally told me she understands that I'm pointing out that her decision making is from how she was raised to not ask for help, and that she's not making any decision at all right now
